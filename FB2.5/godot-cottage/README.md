- `session_complete`: Completed work session data

## Customization

### **Adding New Furniture**
1. Create 3D model in Blender or similar
2. Export as `.glb` file
3. Add to `furniture_prefabs` dictionary in `RoomController.gd`
4. Configure unlock conditions in `GameManager.gd`

### **Creating New Pet Types**
1. Design pet model with animations
2. Extend `PetController.gd` with new pet behaviors
3. Add pet-specific interactions and sounds
4. Configure unlock requirements

### **Weather Effects**

## Integration with FocusBoost Backend

The cottage connects to the FocusBoost productivity tracking system:

```javascript
// Backend sends productivity updates
websocket.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "productivity_update",
  data: {
    productivity_score: userScore,
    activity_type: currentActivity,
    duration: sessionLength
  }
}));
```

### **Real-Time Features**
- **Live Activity Tracking**: See your current work session reflected in the cottage
- **Productivity Visualization**: Room lighting and atmosphere change based on focus
- **Achievement Notifications**: Instant feedback for reaching productivity goals
- **Session History**: Review past work sessions on the in-game computer
